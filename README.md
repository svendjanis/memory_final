# memory_final
This is my memory game project. It is  a card game in which all of the cards are laid face down on a surface and two cards are flipped face up over each turn. The object of the game is to turn over pairs of matching cards.
The game is very simple to play, just start it and you can play right away. You can restart the game in any moment by clicking the repeat button and it will restart your cards, your stars and timer also.
In the begining you have 3 stars, every sixth miss you lose one star. The goal of the game if of course to win with few misses or without even one miss if you are expert.
